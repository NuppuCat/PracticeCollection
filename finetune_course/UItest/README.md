This is a task from comp.CS.530-2024-2025-1 fine-tuning large language models (LLM)

Before run the code, you should install the packages.

pip install flask-cors

pip install flask

pip install transformers *(and the transformers dependency)

Then, run the script on cmd

python app.py

open the index.html 

you can check the result as the video:https://youtu.be/k8_zdhvNo7Q?si=QpxWwkvWeeDKCQ1M

PS:Due to the use of local resources and limited completion time, only the untuned meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct was used as an option for the llama3 model. 

Since it has not been fine-tuned and there are no resources for fine-tuning, the meaning of its output is unclear. The output adjusted by prompt is shown in the notebook.
